Application Explanation : 

The application shows the concept of Exception at run time i.e FormatException.

The line raising the format exception is line no 16 , inside of the if(Convert.ToBoolean(int.Parse(userResponse))) {} block.

The exception happens when the user inputs string value and we are trying to parse that string value to integer. A incomplete parsing leads to the exception 
while successful parsing like entering numerical value does not lead to an exception and executes the statement inside of the if block.

We can use debugger, with the help of watch functionality to see what the exception has happened. 



Handling Exception : 

We can handle the runtime exception such as this one we got above using try catch block. 

try {

	    string userResponse = Console.ReadLine();

            if (Convert.ToBoolean(int.Parse(userResponse)))
            {

                Console.WriteLine("The entered value is a integer");

            }

} catch(Exception ex)
{
	Console.WriteLine("An exception happended : {0}", ex.Message);
}
